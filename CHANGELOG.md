# Changelog

All notable changes to the DesignSetGo plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-07

### New Blocks
- **Comparison Table** - Flexible product/plan comparison with 2–6 dynamic columns, checkmark/X/text cells, featured column highlighting, CTA buttons, and responsive horizontal scroll or stack layout
- **Timeline** - Chronological content display with vertical and horizontal orientations, alternating/left/right layouts, customizable markers (circle/square/diamond), scroll-triggered animations, and optional links
- **Advanced Heading** - Create headings with multiple font styles, weights, and colors using independent heading segments — each segment supports independent typography, color, and rich text formatting within a single semantic heading element (H1–H6)

### New Extensions
- **Grid Mobile Order** - Reorder grid items on mobile without changing the desktop layout or HTML structure — solves the zigzag stacking problem for alternating row designs
- **SVG Patterns** - Add 25+ repeatable SVG background patterns (simple, geometric, organic, decorative, architectural, technical) to sections and groups with customizable color, opacity, and scale — rendered as pure CSS for zero-JavaScript frontend performance

### Added
- **Shape Dividers for Sections** - 24 decorative shapes (waves, curves, triangles, peaks, clouds, zigzag, torn paper, and more) for top and bottom of Section blocks with customizable color, height, width, and flip options
- **Frontend Draft Preview Mode** - Administrators can browse the frontend and see draft content across all pages with a floating banner to toggle between preview and live views
- **Pattern Library** - 150+ reusable section patterns (hero, CTA, FAQ, features, gallery, team, testimonials, pricing, contact, and more) plus 12 complete homepage templates for SaaS, agency, restaurant, real estate, fitness, non-profit, events, education, and portfolio sites
- **Tabs hover colors** - Custom text and background color controls for tab hover states
- **Sticky Header text color on scroll** - Change text and link colors when the header scrolls, so transparent headers with light text can switch to dark text on a solid background
- **Modal hash link reopening** - Modals can now be reopened by clicking anchor links pointing to the same modal ID
- **6 new AI Abilities** - Configure any block's attributes, configure shape dividers, insert blocks into existing containers, and discover all available abilities via the Abilities API
- **4 new icons** - Dumbbell, fire, layers, and refresh icons added to the icon library
- **Reduced motion support** - Animations now respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility preference

- Section block vertical alignment now works properly when min-height is set
- Modal Trigger inherits WordPress button styles from theme.json and supports left/center/right/full alignment
- Icon Button link settings moved to inline toolbar with WordPress LinkControl for URL search and autocomplete, matching core Button block pattern
