            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            You are reviewing a WordPress plugin codebase. Perform a thorough code review.

            ## Instructions
            1. First, run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see all changes
            2. Read and analyze every changed file carefully
            3. Use inline comments for specific code issues
            4. Post a summary comment at the end

            ## Security Review (CRITICAL - Check Every Item)
            - XSS vulnerabilities: unescaped output, missing esc_html/esc_attr/wp_kses
            - SQL injection: direct variable interpolation in queries, missing $wpdb->prepare()
            - CSRF: missing nonce verification on forms/AJAX
            - Sanitization ordering: HTML entities must be decoded BEFORE tag stripping
            - Input validation: validate and sanitize all user inputs
            - File operations: path traversal, unsafe file uploads
            - Authentication/authorization: capability checks, nonce validation

            ## Logic and Correctness
            - Off-by-one errors, boundary conditions
            - Null/undefined checks, type coercion issues
            - Validation logic flaws (e.g., incorrectly rejecting falsy values like 0, false, '0')
            - Race conditions, timing issues
            - Error handling gaps
            - Edge cases not covered

            ## Code Quality
            - DRY violations: duplicated code that should be extracted
            - Functions doing too many things
            - Missing or incorrect error handling
            - Inconsistent patterns within the codebase
            - Unused variables or dead code

            ## WordPress Best Practices
            - Proper hook usage and priorities
            - Correct use of WordPress APIs
            - Proper enqueueing of scripts/styles
            - Translation function usage

            ## Output Format
            For each issue found:
            1. Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to add inline comments on specific lines
            2. Clearly state: SEVERITY (Critical/High/Medium/Low), the problem, and how to fix it

            Post a final summary comment using `gh pr comment` with:
            - Count of issues by severity
            - Key findings that need attention
            - Overall assessment

            Be thorough - a shallow review that misses real issues is worse than no review.
            If you find NO issues, explain what you checked and why the code is correct.
