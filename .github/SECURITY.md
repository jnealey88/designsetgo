## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to DesignSetGo:

1. **Sanitize Input**: Use WordPress sanitization functions
   - `sanitize_text_field()`, `sanitize_textarea_field()`
   - `sanitize_url()`, `esc_url()`
   - `wp_kses_post()`, `wp_kses_allowed_html()`

2. **Escape Output**: Use WordPress escaping functions
   - `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`
   - `esc_url()`, `esc_js()`

3. **Validate Nonces**: For all form submissions and AJAX requests
   - `wp_verify_nonce()`, `check_ajax_referer()`

4. **Check Capabilities**: Use `current_user_can()` for permissions

5. **Prepared Statements**: Use `$wpdb->prepare()` for database queries

6. **No `eval()`**: Never use `eval()` or similar constructs

7. **Validate File Uploads**: Check file types, sizes, and MIME types
