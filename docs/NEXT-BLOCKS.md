Top Priority Recommendations
1. Icon Block ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Why build this first:
Most versatile - Used everywhere (features, services, benefits, steps, process)
Poor free alternatives - Most free icon blocks lack FSE support or require external icon libraries
Foundation block - Will be used inside many other blocks (testimonials, team, features)
Quick to build - Relatively simple compared to complex blocks
Key features:
Built-in icon library (SVG-based, no external dependencies)
Icon picker with search
Size, color, background, border radius controls
Link support
Alignment options
2. Call-to-Action (CTA) Block ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Why:
Critical for conversions - Every landing page needs CTAs
High impact - Directly affects business results
Flexible patterns - Multiple layouts (centered, split, full-width, cards)
Key features:
Heading, description, button(s)
Background options (solid, gradient, image, video)
Multiple layout variations
Icon support (uses Icon block)
3. Testimonials Block ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Why:
Essential social proof - One of the most requested features
Complex done right - Free alternatives are often poorly designed
Multiple use cases - Reviews, client logos, case studies
Key features:
Grid/Slider layouts
Star ratings
Author photo, name, title, company
Quote styling variations
4. Pricing Table ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Why:
SaaS/product essential - Can't build product sites without it
Complex comparison - Needs parent/child structure
High value - Premium plugins charge specifically for this
Key features:
Flexible column layout (1-4 columns)
Feature lists with checkmarks/X marks
Highlight/featured column
Badge support ("Most Popular", "Best Value")
Toggle for monthly/yearly pricing
5. Team Members Block ⭐⭐⭐
Why:
Common requirement - About pages, team pages
Social integration - Link to social profiles
Simple but missing - Few good free options
Key features:
Grid layout
Photo, name, role, bio
Social links (using Icon block)
Hover effects
Strategic Build Order
I recommend this sequence:
1. Icon Block (1-2 days)
   ↓ (Use icons in next blocks)
2. CTA Block (1 day)
3. Testimonials (2 days)
4. Pricing Table (2-3 days)
5. Team Members (1 day)
Why This Order?
Icon Block first - Foundation that other blocks depend on
CTA second - Quick win, high impact, uses Icon block
Testimonials third - High demand, uses Icon block for ratings
Pricing Table fourth - Most complex, benefits from patterns learned
Team Members last - Uses Icon + patterns from previous blocks
After These 5, Consider:
Next tier:
Advanced Heading - Typography effects, gradients, animations
Progress Bar - Stats, skills, loading indicators
Timeline - Company history, process steps, roadmap
Divider/Separator - Section breaks with style
Social Share - Share buttons for posts/pages
Design Philosophy for Each
Icon Block:
Extension approach won't work (no core icon block)
Custom block with built-in SVG library
FSE compatible, pattern-ready
CTA:
Custom block (too complex for extension)
Multiple variations as block patterns
Container block for structure
Testimonials:
Parent/child pattern (like Accordion/Tabs)
Testimonial Group + Testimonial Item
Slider uses Swiper.js (lightweight, modern)
Pricing Table:
Parent/child pattern
Pricing Group + Pricing Column
Feature comparisons
Team Members:
Could be single block with InnerBlocks
Or parent/child for more flexibility
Grid layout using CSS Grid
