## Prerequisites

### Required Software

Before you begin, install these tools:

#### 1. Node.js (JavaScript Runtime)

**What it does:** Runs JavaScript outside the browser, powers our build tools

**Installation:**
- Download from https://nodejs.org/
- Choose LTS version (18.x or higher)
- Verify: `node --version` (should show v18.x.x or higher)

#### 2. npm (Package Manager)

**What it does:** Installs JavaScript dependencies

**Installation:**
- Comes automatically with Node.js
- Verify: `npm --version` (should show 8.x.x or higher)

#### 3. Git (Version Control)

**What it does:** Tracks code changes and collaborates with others

**Installation:**
- Download from https://git-scm.com/
- Verify: `git --version`
- Configure:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

#### 4. Docker Desktop (WordPress Environment)

**What it does:** Runs WordPress locally without installing PHP/MySQL

**Installation:**
- Download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- Install and start Docker Desktop
- Verify: `docker --version`

**Note:** On Mac, you may need to grant Docker permissions in System Preferences → Privacy & Security.

### Optional but Recommended

#### Code Editor

We recommend **Visual Studio Code** (free):
- Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Install these extensions:
  - "ESLint" - JavaScript linting
  - "Prettier" - Code formatting
  - "PHP Intelephense" - PHP support

#### Terminal Application

- **Mac:** Built-in Terminal app or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- **Windows:** [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) or Git Bash
- **Linux:** Your distribution's terminal

## Understanding the Stack

Before diving in, here's what powers DesignSetGo:

### Frontend (What Users See)

```
React (UI Components)
    ↓
WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg)
    ↓
SCSS → CSS (Styles)
```

**Technologies:**
- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **WordPress Block API** - Framework for creating blocks
- **SCSS** - Enhanced CSS with variables and nesting

### Build Process (How Code Gets Compiled)

```
Your Code (src/)
    ↓
Webpack (Bundler)
    ↓
Compiled Code (build/)
    ↓
WordPress (Runtime)
```

**Tools:**
- **Webpack** - Bundles JavaScript and CSS
- **Babel** - Converts modern JavaScript to compatible version
- **@wordpress/scripts** - Official WordPress build tools

### Backend (Server-Side)

```
PHP (WordPress Plugin)
    ↓
Block Registration
    ↓
Database (Block Content)
```

**Technologies:**
- **PHP 8.0+** - Server-side language
- **WordPress 6.4+** - Content management system

### Local Development

```
Docker (Container)
    ↓
WordPress + PHP + MySQL
    ↓
http://localhost:8888
```

**Tools:**
- **@wordpress/env (wp-env)** - Local WordPress environment
- **Docker** - Containerization platform

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

**What is forking?** Creating your own copy of the project on GitHub.

1. Go to https://github.com/jnealey88/designsetgo
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination
4. Wait for the fork to complete

**Result:** You now have `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/designsetgo`

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

**What is cloning?** Downloading the code to your computer.

```bash
# Navigate to where you want the project
cd ~/Documents/GitHub  # or your preferred location

# Clone your fork (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/designsetgo.git

# Enter the project directory
cd designsetgo

# Verify you're in the right place
ls -la  # Should show designsetgo.php, package.json, etc.
```

### Step 3: Add Upstream Remote

**What is upstream?** The original repository you forked from.

```bash
# Add the original repo as "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jnealey88/designsetgo.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/designsetgo.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/designsetgo.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/jnealey88/designsetgo.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/jnealey88/designsetgo.git (push)
```

### Step 4: Install Node Dependencies

**What this does:** Downloads all JavaScript libraries and tools.

```bash
npm install

# This takes 1-2 minutes
# Downloads ~200MB of dependencies into node_modules/
```

**What gets installed:**
- React and WordPress packages
- Webpack and build tools
- Linters (code quality checkers)
- Testing frameworks

### Step 5: Start WordPress Environment

**What this does:** Creates a local WordPress site in Docker.

```bash
# Start WordPress (first run takes 2-3 minutes)
npx wp-env start

# You'll see output like:
# ✔ Building WordPress...
# ✔ Starting WordPress...
# WordPress development site started at http://localhost:8888
# WordPress test site started at http://localhost:8889
# MySQL is listening on port 52000
```

**What's happening:**
1. Downloads WordPress and MySQL Docker images
2. Creates WordPress site with default content
3. Installs DesignSetGo plugin automatically
4. Creates admin user (admin/password)

**Access points:**
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:8888
- **Admin:** http://localhost:8888/wp-admin
- **Credentials:** `admin` / `password`

### Step 6: Start Development Build

**What this does:** Watches for file changes and rebuilds automatically.

Open a **new terminal window** (keep wp-env running!):

```bash
# Navigate to project (if not already there)
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/designsetgo

# Start development mode
npm start

# You'll see:
# assets by path build/blocks/**/*.js
# webpack 5.x.x compiled successfully
#
# Now editing files in src/ will auto-rebuild!
```

**Keep this running while you develop.** Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### Step 7: Verify Everything Works

1. **Go to WordPress admin:** http://localhost:8888/wp-admin
2. **Log in:** Username: `admin`, Password: `password`
3. **Create a test page:**
   - Click "Pages" → "Add New"
   - Click the **+** button
   - Search for "DesignSetGo"
   - You should see all blocks (Accordion, Tabs, Icon, etc.)
4. **Insert a block:**
   - Click "Icon" block
   - It should insert and show controls
5. **Preview:**
   - Click "Preview" → "Preview in new tab"
   - Icon should display on frontend

**✅ If you see blocks, setup is complete!**

## Your First Change

Let's make a simple change to understand the workflow.

### Example: Change Icon Block Default Size

#### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on main
git checkout main

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/my-first-change

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch  # Should show * feature/my-first-change
```

#### 2. Find the File to Edit

```bash
# Icon block files are in:
ls src/blocks/icon/

# You should see:
# - block.json (configuration)
# - edit.js (editor component)
# - save.js (frontend output)
# - style.scss (styles)
```

#### 3. Make a Change

Open `src/blocks/icon/block.json` in your editor:

```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "iconSize": {
      "type": "number",
      "default": 24  // Change this to 32
    }
  }
}
```

**Change `24` to `32` and save the file.**

#### 4. See Your Change

The build should automatically reload (watch the `npm start` terminal).

**Test it:**
1. Go to http://localhost:8888/wp-admin
2. Refresh the page
3. Insert a new Icon block
4. The default icon should now be larger!

#### 5. Commit Your Change

```bash
# Check what changed
git status

# Should show:
# modified:   src/blocks/icon/block.json

# Stage the change
git add src/blocks/icon/block.json

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: increase default icon size to 32px"
```

#### 6. Push Your Branch

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/my-first-change
```

#### 7. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/designsetgo
2. GitHub will show a banner: "feature/my-first-change had recent pushes"
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Fill out the description
5. Click "Create pull request"

**🎉 Congratulations! You've made your first contribution!**

## Development Tools

### npm Scripts

Common commands you'll use:

```bash
# Development
npm start              # Watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
npm run build          # Production build (one-time)

# Code Quality
npm run lint:js        # Check JavaScript for errors
npm run lint:css       # Check CSS/SCSS for errors
npm run format         # Auto-format all code (Prettier)

# Testing
npm run test:unit      # Run Jest unit tests
npm run test:e2e       # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui    # E2E tests with visual interface

# WordPress Environment
npx wp-env start       # Start WordPress
npx wp-env stop        # Stop WordPress
npx wp-env clean all   # Reset WordPress (fresh install)
npx wp-env logs        # View PHP error logs

# Package Management
npm run plugin-zip     # Create distributable ZIP file
```

### VS Code Integration

If using VS Code, create `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "[php]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client"
  },
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact"
  ]
}
```

This enables auto-formatting on save.

### Browser DevTools

**Testing in the editor:**
1. Open http://localhost:8888/wp-admin in Chrome/Firefox
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Check **Console** tab for JavaScript errors
4. Use **Elements** tab to inspect block markup
5. Use **Network** tab to see asset loading

**Testing on frontend:**
1. Preview a page with your block
2. Open DevTools
3. Same checks as above

## Common Workflows

### Daily Development

```bash
# 1. Start of day - Get latest changes
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
npm install  # If dependencies changed

# 2. Start services
npx wp-env start  # Terminal 1
npm start         # Terminal 2

# 3. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 4. Make changes to src/
# 5. Test in browser (http://localhost:8888)
# 6. Commit and push

# 7. End of day - Stop services
# Terminal 2: Ctrl+C (stop npm start)
npx wp-env stop
```

### Updating Your Fork

```bash
# Get latest changes from main repository
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Push to your fork
git push origin main

# Update your feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main
```

### Fixing Build Errors

```bash
# 1. Clean node_modules
