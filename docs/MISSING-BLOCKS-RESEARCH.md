## Executive Summary

This research identifies critical gaps in the WordPress block ecosystem that Airo Blocks will address. Based on official WordPress proposals, community feedback, and competitive analysis, we've identified **15 high-priority blocks** that are missing or inadequate in WordPress core.

**Key Finding:** Most competitors charge $69-129/year for these features. Airo Blocks will offer them **100% free**, creating massive competitive advantage.

---

## Most Requested Missing Blocks

The WordPress community has identified several significant gaps in the core Gutenberg block library. Matias Ventura, Gutenberg's Lead Architect, formally proposed adding 13 niche blocks that have stalled in development, including Icons, Tabs, Accordion, Slider/Carousel, Breadcrumbs, Table of Contents, Mega Menus, Time to Read, Playlist, Stretchy Text, MathML, Marquee, and Dialog blocks.‚Äã

## Critical Missing Blocks (Detailed Analysis)

### 1. **Tabs Block** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL

**Community Consensus:** Community members consider this "defo one that should 100% be a core/default block," as it's a fundamental web design pattern that currently requires third-party plugins.‚Äã

**Why Airo Should Prioritize:**
- Top requested feature across all research
- All major competitors have it (mostly paid)
- Search volume: ~18,000/month
- **Status: ADDED TO PHASE 1**

**Features to Include:**
- Horizontal/vertical layouts
- Icon support per tab
- Mobile responsive (converts to accordion)
- Deep linking (URL hash navigation)
- Keyboard navigation (accessibility)
- Multiple style variations

**Competitive Analysis:**
- Stackable: Pro only ($99/yr)
- Kadence: Pro only ($129/yr)
- Otter: Pro only ($69/yr)
- **Airo: FREE ‚úÖ**

### 2. **Icons/SVG Support** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL

The lack of native SVG icon functionality is particularly problematic for block theme developers who cannot easily include icons in their designs without relying on plugins. WordPress has discussed adding SVG support for over a decade but hasn't resolved security concerns.‚Äã

**Why Airo Should Prioritize:**
- Core WordPress still hasn't solved this (security concerns)
- Essential for modern design
- **Status: ADDED TO PHASE 1** (Icon + Icon List blocks)

**Features Included:**
- 500+ Font Awesome icons (Phase 1)
- Custom SVG upload (Phase 2, with sanitization)
- Icon size/color controls
- Icon library browser
- FSE-compatible (uses theme colors)

---

### 3. **Accordion** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH

While WordPress includes a Details block that can function as an accordion, it lacks the polish and features users expect, forcing theme authors to manipulate it in ways that may not be accessible.‚Äã

**Why Airo Should Prioritize:**
- Core version too basic
- Common use case (FAQs)
- **Status: ADDED TO PHASE 1**

**Features to Include:**
- Multiple items open simultaneously
- Custom icons (chevron, plus/minus)
- Animation options
- Schema markup for FAQ (SEO)
- Improved accessibility over core

---

### 4. **Breadcrumbs** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê MEDIUM

Essential for site navigation and SEO, breadcrumbs are standard on most websites but require plugin support in WordPress.‚Äã

**Status: PHASE 2**

**Features to Include:**
- Auto-generate from page hierarchy
- Schema.org markup (SEO)
- Custom separator
- Show/hide home
- FSE theme integration

---

### 5. **Slider/Carousel** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH

A ubiquitous web component that's completely absent from core blocks.‚Äã

**Status: PHASE 2** (Logo Carousel, Post Carousel)

**Features to Include:**
- Auto-scroll with pause on hover
- Touch/swipe support
- Navigation arrows
- Pagination dots
- Multiple items per view
- Lazy loading

---

### 6. **Table of Contents** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê MEDIUM

Particularly valuable for long-form content, this block is widely requested but only available through plugins.‚Äã

**Status: PHASE 2**

**Features to Include:**
- Auto-generate from headings
- Smooth scroll to anchor
- Collapsible sections
- Numbered/bulleted styles
- Update on content change

---

### 7. **Mega Menus** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê MEDIUM

Modern navigation patterns require mega menu functionality, which currently necessitates specific block editor plugins.‚Äã

**Status: PHASE 3** (Theme Builder)

**Features to Include:**
- Multi-column dropdowns
- Rich content in menus (images, icons)
- Responsive mobile menu
- Part of theme builder feature

---

## The Responsive Spacing Problem ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL

Beyond individual blocks, the community has identified **responsive spacing controls** as "the number one fail of current WordPress core". Every major block page builder includes the ability to control spacing (margin, padding) on different device screen sizes, but this fundamental feature is completely missing from core Gutenberg. This limitation significantly hampers responsive design capabilities.‚Äã‚Äã

**Airo Blocks Solution:**
- **Status: PHASE 1 - All blocks include responsive controls**
- Device-specific spacing (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Device-specific typography
- Show/hide per device
- FSE-compatible implementation

**Why This Matters:**
- Core WordPress doesn't have this
- Essential for professional responsive design
- Major differentiator vs core blocks
- All competitors charge for this

## Block Theme Limitations & Opportunities

The shift to block themes has created unique challenges. Theme authors who previously had unlimited design flexibility now face severe constraints when building block themes. They cannot bundle custom blocks in themes submitted to the official WordPress directory, and when users lack necessary blocks, they encounter the frustrating "your site doesn't include support for the [name] block" message.‚Äã

**Justin Tadlock (prominent theme developer) quote:**
> "There have been many moments in the last three years where I'd have 95% of the work done, speeding toward the finish line of a block theme project. Then I'd smash into a brick wall. Quite often that wall was a missing design component".‚Äã

**Opportunity for Airo Blocks:**
- Theme developers can recommend Airo Blocks as the "missing piece"
- FSE-first approach ensures perfect theme compatibility
- Free = no barrier to recommendation
- Potential partnerships with theme developers

---

## Block Extensibility Issues

Beyond missing blocks, developers struggle with core block extensibility. The community has identified that you cannot easily modify markup in the Editor without triggering block validation errors, making it difficult to extend existing core blocks with additional features like custom icons or attributes.‚Äã

**Airo Blocks Solution:**
- Build from scratch with extensibility in mind
- Provide hooks and filters for developers
- Open source = community can extend
- Document customization patterns

---

## Community Solutions & WordPress Direction

To address the tension between keeping WordPress lean and providing necessary functionality, Matias Ventura proposed "Core/Canonical blocks" - blocks designed and maintained by WordPress contributors but distributed through the Block Directory rather than bundled with core. This compromise would allow endorsed implementations of common patterns without bloating the core installation.‚Äã

The WordPress.com implementation already includes additional blocks through Jetpack, acknowledging that core blocks alone are insufficient for most users' needs.‚Äã

**What This Means for Airo Blocks:**
- WordPress acknowledges core blocks are insufficient
- Core/Canonical blocks may take years to implement
- Airo Blocks fills the gap NOW
- Being free and open-source aligns with WordPress philosophy
- Could become the "de facto standard" block library
