## The Job
What progress is the user trying to make at this moment
State it as a change in their life, not as a feature request.

Format:
"When I am [situation], I want to [progress], so I can [desired outcome]."

### DesignSetGo's Primary Job

**"When I'm building a WordPress site, I want to add professional design features without fighting complex tools, so I can deliver quality work faster and move on to the next project."**

Secondary Jobs:
- "When I see a design in my head, I want to build it in WordPress without limitations, so I can match my vision."
- "When I need a form or interactive element, I want it to just work, so I don't waste time troubleshooting."
- "When I use WordPress blocks, I want them to do more, so I don't need to install five different plugins."

---

## The Struggle Moment
What triggers the switch
Describe the real pain or friction that pushes the user to seek a new solution.

### DesignSetGo User Struggles

**Developer/Designer:**
- "Elementor and Divi feel heavy and break when WordPress updates."
- "I know what I want to build but WordPress blocks can't do it."
- "I'm installing 10 plugins just to get basic features like forms and tabs."
- "Page builders lock me into their ecosystem - if I switch, I lose everything."

**Agency/Freelancer:**
- "Every page builder has a learning curve - I don't have time to learn another one."
- "My clients need to update their sites but page builders are too complex for them."
- "Sites feel slow and bloated, clients complain about performance."

**Site Owner:**
- "I want my site to look modern but I don't know how to code."
- "The Block Editor feels limiting compared to what I see on other sites."
- "I need a contact form but I don't want another subscription plugin."

---

## Forces of Progress
Identify the four forces that shape the user's choice.
Fill in each one with simple language.

### Push of the Problem
What frustrates the user today

- Current page builders are bloated and slow my site down
- I need 5-10 plugins to get the features I want
- Page builders break with WordPress updates
- Learning curve is steep for complex tools
- I'm locked into an ecosystem - can't leave without losing content
- My editor looks nothing like the frontend
- Plugins conflict with each other
- I'm paying monthly subscriptions just for basic features

### Pull of the New Solution
What about DesignSetGo feels attractive

- Works exactly like WordPress - if you know blocks, you know this
- 43 blocks + 11 extensions in one lightweight plugin (no subscriptions)
- Extensions enhance ANY block (even core WordPress blocks)
- Built with WordPress standards - won't break on updates
- Performance-focused - no bloat, no slow load times
- What you see in the editor is what you get on the frontend
- Complete form system with no external services
- One plugin replaces multiple plugins

### Anxiety of Change
What worries them about trying or switching

- "Will this work with my theme?"
- "Is this just another page builder I have to learn?"
- "What if I install it and it breaks my site?"
- "Will it slow down my site?"
- "What happens when I update WordPress?"
- "Can I remove it later without losing my content?"
- "Is there enough documentation?"

### Habit of the Present
What keeps them doing things the old way

- "I already know Elementor/Divi, even if it's frustrating"
- "I've built sites this way for years"
- "My clients expect the [current tool] interface"
- "I have templates in my current page builder"
- "Switching means learning something new"
- "I'm used to the quirks and workarounds"
- "What if the Block Editor doesn't have enough features?"

This section guides design and messaging.

---

## The Required Outcomes
What must be true for the user to feel progress
These are not features. These are states the user wants to reach.

### DesignSetGo Required Outcomes

- "I see my design come to life immediately without refresh delays"
- "I feel confident making changes without breaking my site"
- "My site loads fast and doesn't feel bloated"
- "I can hand off the site to my client and they can update it"
- "I don't need to learn a new system - it feels like WordPress"
- "My blocks work with any theme, including FSE themes"
- "I can remove the plugin later if needed without losing content structure"
- "I get forms, layouts, and interactions without multiple plugins"
- "Updates don't break my site"
- "I stay in control - no black boxes or mysterious output"

---

## Barriers to Progress
What gets in the way of making the switch
List real blockers. Keep them honest.

### DesignSetGo Barriers

**Discovery Barriers:**
- "I've never heard of this plugin"
- "It's not in the mainstream page builder conversation"
- "No big YouTuber has covered it yet"

**Trust Barriers:**
- "Is this actively maintained?"
- "What if the developer abandons it?"
- "Only 1.0.0 - is it stable enough for client work?"
- "Not enough reviews/installs to validate quality"

**Time Barriers:**
- "I don't have time to test yet another tool"
- "Learning curve - even if small - is still time"
- "I'd need to rebuild my templates"

**Technical Barriers:**
- "Will it work with my specific theme/plugins?"
- "What's the performance impact?"
- "Can I customize it if needed?"

**Migration Barriers:**
- "I have 50 sites on [current tool]"
- "Converting existing sites seems overwhelming"
- "What about my existing content?"

## JTBD Scorecard
Rate the experience on how well it delivers progress.
Use a simple scale: Strong, Medium, Weak.

### DesignSetGo Current State

| Progress Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| **Does the user see progress fast?** | **Strong** | Real-time preview, no refresh delays, built with WordPress patterns users already know |
| **Does the user feel safe?** | **Strong** | Built with WP standards, proper deprecation system, editor/frontend parity means no surprises |
| **Does the user stay in control?** | **Strong** | No proprietary markup, clean output, can inspect/customize everything, transparent CSS |
| **Does the product remove friction?** | **Strong** | One plugin replaces many, works like native WordPress, 43 blocks + 11 extensions in one place |
| **Does the product reduce anxiety?** | **Medium** | Technical quality is strong BUT trust barriers exist (new plugin, no big community yet) |
| **Does the product help them continue the job later?** | **Strong** | Native blocks = future-proof, FSE compatible, can remove plugin without losing structure |
| **Does the user return because they see more progress?** | **Medium** | Core functionality complete BUT lacks patterns, templates, and discovery features that drive repeat engagement |

### Weak Areas = Next Opportunities

**Medium: Reduce Anxiety**
- Need social proof (reviews, case studies, showcases)
- Documentation/video tutorials for common use cases
- "Trusted by X sites" metrics
- Showcase of real sites built with DesignSetGo

**Medium: Return Engagement**
- Block patterns library
- Pre-made templates
- Community showcase
- Regular feature announcements
- Newsletter with design tips

## Anti-Jobs
What not to build
List things users do not hire your product to do.

This keeps scope clean.

### What Users DON'T Hire DesignSetGo For

**Not a Page Builder Replacement (in the traditional sense):**
- Users don't hire DesignSetGo to get a drag-and-drop visual builder separate from WordPress
- Users don't hire DesignSetGo to build a completely different editing experience

**Not Theme Framework:**

**Not eCommerce Solution:**
- Users don't hire DesignSetGo to replace WooCommerce
- Users don't hire DesignSetGo to handle payments or inventory
- Users don't hire DesignSetGo to build online stores (though it can style them)

**Not Content Management:**
- Users don't hire DesignSetGo to manage blog posts, pages, or media

### What We WON'T Build (Staying True to the Job)

❌ Separate visual builder interface
❌ Proprietary page templates that lock users in
❌ Non-standard output that breaks without the plugin
❌ Heavy frameworks that slow sites down
❌ Monthly subscription for basic features
❌ Features that already exist in WordPress core
❌ "Magic" AI that removes user control

### Success Metrics

**Measure progress toward the job:**
- Time from install to first published page
- Number of plugins replaced per install
- Performance score delta (before/after)
- Client handoff satisfaction
- Theme compatibility rate
- WordPress update survival rate
- User retention after 30/90 days
- "Replaced [page builder]" conversion rate

### The North Star

**"Make building professional WordPress sites feel as natural as using WordPress itself, but with the power users expect from page builders - without the bloat, lock-in, or learning curve."**

Every feature decision should pass this test:
1. Does it make progress faster?
2. Does it reduce anxiety?
3. Does it maintain control?
4. Is it WordPress-native?
5. Could we remove it tomorrow without breaking sites?

If the answer to #5 is "no" - reconsider the approach.

## Feature Roadmap by Horizon

This section translates the JTBD framework into concrete features organized by development horizons. Each horizon focuses on a specific user outcome and ties directly back to the jobs users hire DesignSetGo to do.

### HORIZON 1 (NEXT 1–2 RELEASES)

**Theme:** "Time-to-value and plugin replacement"

**Goal:** Help users feel progress in the first week. Reduce the number of separate plugins they need for basic marketing sites.

**Target Versions:** v1.1–v1.3

#### A. Layout and Content Structure

**Card Block**

- **Role:** Reusable unit for pricing, features, services, and team members
- **Why:** Every marketing page needs "cards." Designers see this in their head but hit the layout wall with core blocks
- **JTBD Link:** "Add professional design features without fighting complex tools"

**Details:**
- Image, title, subtitle, body, CTA, badge
- Layout presets for image top, left, or no image
- Ties into Grid / Row blocks so users drop "Card" into existing layout tools

**Card Group Preset Support** (enhancement, not a new block)
- Role: Use existing Grid / Row blocks plus "Card" to build full sections fast
- Section presets for 2, 3, 4 cards
- Gap, alignment, and equal height controls tuned for this use

**Outcome:** "First complex layout" and "first landing page" feel much faster to build.

#### B. Conversion and Trust Blocks

**Testimonial Block**

- **Role:** Replace separate testimonial plugins
- **Features:**
  - Avatar or image, name, role, company, quote
  - Rating option that stays presentational, not a review system
  - Works inside Slider for "testimonial carousel" pattern

**Pricing Table Block**

- **Role:** Replace common pricing table plugins
- **Features:**
  - Columns for plans, with labels for "Most popular" etc.
  - Plan name, price, period, feature list, CTA
  - Built on Card or Grid internals for consistency

**FAQ Block Preset** (Accordion enhancement)

- **Role:** Turn existing Accordion into a "FAQ mode" with better defaults
- **Features:**
  - Question / answer schema-friendly markup where possible
  - Toggle to show first item open
  - FAQ pattern that site owners drop on pages without extra thinking

**Outcome:** Users move from "I need 5 plugins" to "DesignSetGo covers testimonials, pricing, FAQ, and layout" for basic sites.

#### C. Interaction and Motion

**Modal / Popup Block**

- **Role:** Replace lightweight modal plugins while staying in content scope
- **Features:**
  - Trigger options: button, link, or time / scroll percentage
  - Works with any blocks inside
  - Performance-first, no extra framework

**Guardrail:** No site-wide popup manager. Keep it content-level. Users add it to a page like any other block.

#### D. Forms: Polish and Trust

**Form Presets**

- **Role:** Reduce setup time for common forms
- **Features:**
  - Ready combinations inside Form Builder for Contact, Lead capture, Newsletter
  - Opinionated spacing and layout presets that match Section / Row

**Form Success Message Block** (or visual state)

- **Role:** Make "First form submission" feel polished
- **Features:**
  - Clear success state above the fold
  - Option to show summary of submitted values for reassurance

#### Success Signals for Horizon 1

- Fewer "I still need plugin X" comments
- Shorter time from install to first full marketing page
- More "replaced [plugin type]" stories in reviews and docs

---

### HORIZON 2 (3–6 MONTHS)

**Theme:** "Return engagement and patterns built on blocks"

**Target Versions:** v1.4–v1.8

#### A. Pattern-Friendly "Section" Blocks

These stay as blocks but ship with pattern-first intent.

**Hero Section Presets** (Section + Row + Card + Button)

  - Smooth entry animations preconfigured through existing animation extension

**Feature List Block**

- **Role:** Compact middle ground between Icon List and full Card
- **Features:**

  - Vertical or horizontal mode
  - Optimized for "Three features under a hero" sections

**Process / Steps Block**

- **Role:** Replace "how it works" plugins
- **Features:**
  - Numbered steps with title and text
  - Horizontal and vertical layouts
  - Optional connector lines for timeline style

**Note:** All of these rely on existing container and visual primitives, so maintenance stays low.

#### B. "Second Site" and Agency Helper Blocks

**Section Header Block**

- **Role:** Consistent headings across sections and pages
- **Features:**
  - Eyebrow text, main heading, optional description, alignment controls
  - Opinionated spacing so sections align across the page

- **Role:** Drive return use
- **Includes:**
  - About page pattern collection built from existing blocks

  - Contact page pattern with form, FAQs, and map placeholder

**Note:** These live as pattern sets, but the roadmap here highlights the block readiness and presets those patterns depend on.
