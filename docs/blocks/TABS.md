- You have many tabs: Lower breakpoint for earlier conversion

---

- Test links before sharing
- Keep anchors short and memorable
- Use consistent naming across your site

**DON'T:**

## Best Practices

### User Experience

**DO:**
- Keep tab count reasonable (3-7 tabs ideal)
- Use clear, concise tab labels (1-2 words)
- Put most important content in first tab
- Provide visual feedback for active tab
- Test on mobile devices
- Use icons sparingly (don't clutter)

**DON'T:**
- Hide critical content in later tabs
- Use overly technical labels
- Create too many tabs (consider navigation menu instead)
- Rely on color alone to indicate active state
- Forget to test keyboard navigation
- Use tabs for sequential content (use steps/wizard instead)

---

### Content Organization

**When to Use Tabs:**
- Related content that can be viewed independently
- Comparison scenarios (pricing, features)
- Space-constrained layouts
- Dashboard-style interfaces
- Product information organization

**When NOT to Use Tabs:**
- Sequential processes (use steps/wizard)
- Content that should be visible simultaneously
- Very short content (unnecessary hiding)
- Critical information users must see (keep visible)
- SEO-critical content (tabs may impact indexing)

---

### Performance

**Optimization Tips:**
- Tabs are lightweight with minimal JavaScript
- All tab content loads immediately (not lazy-loaded)
- Consider image optimization in tab content
- Avoid embedding multiple videos in tabs (bandwidth)
- Test page load time with content-heavy tabs

**SEO Considerations:**
- Search engines can index tab content
- All content is in page HTML (not AJAX loaded)
- Deep linking improves discoverability
- Use semantic headings inside tabs
- Don't hide critical keywords in tabs

---

## FAQ

**Q: How many tabs can I add?**
A: No technical limit, but 3-7 tabs is ideal for UX. More than 10 tabs should use vertical orientation or consider an alternative UI pattern.

**Q: Can I use icons on tabs?**
A: Yes! Each Tab block has an Icon Picker. Choose from a library of icons and position them left, right, or top of the tab title.

**Q: Do tabs work with page caching?**
A: Yes! Tabs work with all caching plugins. They use client-side JavaScript that runs after page load.

**Q: Can I link to a specific tab from another page?**
A: Yes! Enable "Deep Linking" in the Tabs block settings. Then link to `yoursite.com/page#tab-anchor`.

**Q: How do I change which tab is active by default?**
A: In the editor, simply click the tab you want to be active. The editor remembers and saves the active tab state.

**Q: Can I use tabs inside tabs (nested tabs)?**
A: Technically yes, but not recommended. Nested tabs create poor UX and confuse users.

**Q: Why do my tabs wrap to multiple rows on desktop?**
A: Too many tabs or long tab titles. Solutions:
  - Reduce tab count
  - Shorten tab titles
  - Use vertical orientation
  - Increase breakpoint for earlier mobile conversion

**Q: Can I style individual tabs differently?**
A: Tab navigation uses consistent styling (from parent Tabs block). However, each Tab's content panel can have unique colors, padding, and backgrounds.

**Q: Do tabs affect SEO?**
A: Tab content is in the HTML and indexable by search engines. However, Google may prioritize visible content. Use deep linking and ensure critical content is in first tab.

**Q: How do I remove a tab?**
A: Select the Tab block (click in its content area), then click the three dots in the toolbar and select "Remove Tab". You must have at least 1 tab.

**Q: Can I reorder tabs?**
A: Yes! Use the up/down arrows in the block toolbar, or drag and drop in the List View.

**Q: Why don't my tab colors show?**
A: Check that you're setting colors in the right place:
  - Tab navigation colors: Set on parent Tabs block
  - Content panel colors: Set on individual Tab blocks
