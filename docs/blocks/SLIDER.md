## Best Practices

### Performance

**Optimize Images:**
- Compress images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG, ShortPixel)
- Use appropriate image sizes (don't use 4K images for 500px slider)
- Consider lazy loading for sliders below the fold
- Use WebP format for better compression

**Reduce Motion:**
- The slider automatically respects `prefers-reduced-motion` preference
- Users who disable animations see instant transitions
- Auto-play is automatically disabled for reduced motion users

**Limit Slides:**
- Keep total slides under 20 for best performance
- More slides = larger DOM = slower performance
- Consider pagination or filters for large collections

---

### User Experience

**DO:**
- Make navigation obvious (visible arrows/dots)
- Use auto-play sparingly (can be annoying)
- Provide pause controls for auto-play
- Ensure content is readable on all devices
- Test swipe/drag interactions on touch devices
- Use consistent slide heights
- Provide alternative navigation (arrows AND dots)

**DON'T:**
- Use very fast auto-play intervals (< 3 seconds)
- Hide all navigation controls
- Use too many slides (overwhelming)
- Mix wildly different content types
- Forget to test on mobile devices
- Use very long transition durations (> 1 second)
- Auto-play sliders with critical information

---

### Content Guidelines

**Slide Content:**
- Keep text concise and scannable
- Use high-contrast text on backgrounds
- Include clear calls-to-action
- Maintain consistent visual hierarchy
- Test readability at all screen sizes

**Accessibility:**
- Add meaningful ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers
- Provide text alternatives for image-only slides
- Use sufficient color contrast

---

## Accessibility

The Slider block is built with accessibility as a priority:

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- `Left Arrow` - Previous slide
- `Right Arrow` - Next slide
- `Home` - Jump to first slide
- `End` - Jump to last slide
- `Tab` - Navigate between controls (arrows, dots)

**Screen Reader Support:**
- `role="region"` with descriptive ARIA label
- Each slide has `role="group"` and `aria-roledescription="slide"`
- Live region announces slide changes ("Slide 2 of 5")
- Inactive slides have `aria-hidden="true"`
- Navigation buttons have descriptive labels

**Focus Management:**
- Slider is keyboard focusable
- Current slide is in tab order
- Inactive slides are removed from tab order
- Focus indicators are visible

**Reduced Motion:**
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` system preference
- Disables transitions for motion-sensitive users
- Disables auto-play when reduced motion is preferred

---

### Accessibility Best Practices

**When Creating Sliders:**

1. **Provide Descriptive ARIA Labels**
   - Customize ARIA label to describe slider purpose
   - Examples: "Customer testimonials", "Featured products", "Photo gallery"

2. **Ensure Keyboard Access**
   - Test all navigation with keyboard only
   - Verify arrow keys work
   - Ensure Tab key reaches all controls

3. **Test with Screen Reader**
   - Verify slide changes are announced
   - Check that slide count is communicated
   - Ensure navigation labels are clear

4. **Color Contrast**
   - Text must have 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
   - Navigation controls must be visible
   - Test with various color blindness simulations

5. **Auto-play Considerations**
   - Provide pause button for auto-play
   - Keep intervals long enough to read content (5+ seconds)
   - Consider disabling auto-play for content-heavy sliders

---

## Troubleshooting

### Slider Not Displaying Correctly

**Check:**
1. **Slides exist** - Slider needs at least one slide block inside
2. **JavaScript loaded** - Check browser console for errors
3. **Theme compatibility** - Some themes may have CSS conflicts
4. **Height setting** - Ensure height or aspect ratio is set appropriately
5. **Content overflow** - Check if slide content is too large for container

**Common Fixes:**
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check for JavaScript console errors (F12)
- Temporarily disable other plugins to check for conflicts
- Increase slider height if content is cut off

---

### Navigation Not Working

**Check:**
1. **Arrows/Dots enabled** - Verify in Slider Settings
2. **Multiple slides** - Need at least 2 slides for navigation
3. **JavaScript errors** - Check browser console
4. **Theme conflicts** - Some themes override styles

**Common Fixes:**
- Ensure show arrows/dots is toggled on
- Add more slides (need minimum of 2)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Increase z-index if navigation is behind content

---

### Auto-play Issues

**Remember:**
- Auto-play only works when slider is visible in viewport
- Auto-play is disabled in the editor (test on frontend)
- Respects reduced motion preferences
- Stops after user interaction (if pause on interaction enabled)

**Debug Steps:**
1. Save and preview page (auto-play disabled in editor)
2. Scroll slider into view
3. Wait for interval to elapse
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify auto-play is enabled in settings

---

### Slides Jumping or Flickering

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Images loading** - Slider initializes before images load
2. **Height calculation** - Fixed height not set
3. **CSS conflicts** - Theme or plugin CSS interfering

**Solutions:**
- Set fixed height instead of auto
- Ensure images have width/height attributes
- Check for CSS conflicts in browser inspector
- Increase transition duration for smoother animations

---

### Mobile/Touch Issues

**Common Problems:**
1. **Swipe not working** - Ensure swipeable is enabled
2. **Arrows too small** - Increase arrow size for mobile
3. **Content cut off** - Adjust mobile slides per view
4. **Overlapping elements** - Check z-index and positioning

**Solutions:**
- Enable swipeable in behavior settings
- Increase arrow size to 40px+ for better touch targets
- Set mobile slides per view to 1
- Test on actual devices, not just browser resize

---

### Performance Problems

**If slider is slow:**
1. **Too many slides** - Reduce to 10-15 maximum
2. **Large images** - Compress and optimize
3. **Complex content** - Simplify slide content
4. **Multiple sliders** - Limit sliders per page

**Optimization:**
- Compress images (use TinyPNG, ShortPixel)
- Use appropriate image dimensions
- Limit slides to 15-20 maximum
- Disable auto-play if not needed
- Remove unnecessary block gap/padding

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How many slides can I add?**
A: Technically unlimited, but keep under 20 for best performance. More slides means larger page size and slower rendering.

**Q: Can I use videos in slides?**
A: Yes! Add a Video block or Embed block (YouTube, Vimeo) inside any slide. Be aware that videos increase page load time.

**Q: Can I nest sliders (slider inside slider)?**
A: Not recommended. It creates poor UX and can cause conflicts. Use multiple separate sliders instead.

**Q: Why does fade/zoom only show 1 slide?**
A: Fade and zoom effects only work with single slides. These effects fade/zoom the entire slide, so multiple slides per view isn't possible. Switch to slide effect for multi-slide view.

**Q: How do I make slides the same height?**
A: Set a fixed height in Layout Settings (e.g., 500px) or use aspect ratio mode. This ensures all slides have consistent height.

**Q: Can I customize arrow/dot appearance?**
A: Yes! Use the Color settings to change colors. For advanced customization, use the Custom CSS Extension or Additional CSS in Customizer.

**Q: Does the slider work with page caching?**
A: Yes! The slider uses client-side JavaScript, so it works with all caching plugins.

**Q: Can I link entire slides?**
A: While slides themselves aren't clickable, you can add a full-width/height link or button inside the slide content to achieve this effect.

**Q: How do I disable navigation on mobile?**
A: You can hide arrows/dots with custom CSS for mobile devices. The slider will still work with swipe gestures.

**Q: Can I control slider with custom JavaScript?**
A: Yes! The slider dispatches custom events (`dsgo-slider-change`) that you can listen to. Access the slider instance via WeakMap if needed.

**Q: Why is my auto-play not working?**
A: Auto-play is disabled in the editor (by design). Save and preview on the frontend to test. Also check that the slider is visible in the viewport and auto-play is enabled in settings.

**Q: Can I use different transition effects for different slides?**
A: No, the transition effect applies to all slides in a slider. Create separate slider blocks if you need different effects.

**Q: How do I create a full-width slider?**
A: Select the Slider block and in the toolbar, choose "Full Width" alignment. Or use the Align option in the block settings.
