## How It Works

### Expansion Behavior

**Default State:**
- All panels are equal width
- Divided evenly across the accordion width
- Example: 3 panels = 33.33% each

**Expanded State:**
- One panel expands to take more space
- Other panels compress to accommodate
- Expansion ratio controls size difference
- Smooth CSS transition animates the change

**Example with 3 panels:**
- Default: 33% | 33% | 33%
- Panel 2 Expanded (3x ratio): 16% | 68% | 16%

### Interaction Modes

**Hover Mode (Desktop):**
- Mouse over panel to expand it
- Works automatically on non-touch devices
- Mouse leave resets to default expanded panel (or none)
- Smooth, fluid interaction

**Click/Tap Mode:**
- Click or tap to expand panel
- Stays expanded until another panel is clicked
- Better for touch devices
- More deliberate interaction

**Auto-Detection:**
- Touch devices automatically use click mode
- Even if hover mode is selected
- Ensures mobile usability

---

## Settings & Configuration

### Layout Panel

**Height**
- Default: 500px
- Units: px, vh, rem
- Fixed height for entire accordion
- All panels share this height

**Values:**
- Small: 300-400px (compact)
- Medium: 500-600px (balanced, default)
- Large: 700-900px (impactful)
- Full viewport: 100vh (hero section)

**Tips:**
- Use `vh` for viewport-relative sizing
- Test on mobile - reduce height if needed
- Ensure content fits within height

---

**Gap Between Items**
- Default: 4px
- Units: px, rem
- Space between panels
- Creates separation lines

**Values:**
- No gap: 0px (seamless)
- Tight: 2-4px (subtle, default)
- Medium: 8-12px (clear separation)
- Wide: 16px+ (bold lines)

**Visual Effect:**
- Tight gaps: Cohesive, single unit
- Wide gaps: Individual panels, more breathing room

---

### Expansion Behavior Panel

**Expanded Ratio**
- Default: 3
- Range: 2 to 5 (0.5 increments)
- How much larger the expanded panel becomes

**Ratio Explained:**
- 2x: Modest expansion (2x size of collapsed)
- 3x: Balanced expansion (default)
- 4x: Strong expansion
- 5x: Dramatic expansion

**Formula:**
- Expanded panel: Ratio × collapsed size
- Collapsed panels: Remaining space divided equally

**Example (3 panels, 3x ratio):**
- Collapsed width: 1 unit each
- Expanded width: 3 units
- Total: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 units
- Percentages: 20% | 60% | 20%

---

**Transition Duration**
- Default: 0.5s (500ms)
- Units: s (seconds), ms (milliseconds)
- Speed of expansion/collapse animation

**Values:**
- Fast: 0.2-0.3s (snappy)
- Medium: 0.4-0.6s (balanced, default)
- Slow: 0.8-1.2s (dramatic)
- Very slow: 1.5s+ (overly slow)

**Help Text:** "Speed of expansion/collapse animation"

**Tips:**
- Faster feels responsive and modern
- Slower feels luxurious and deliberate
- Match to your brand personality
- Test with actual content

---

---

---

---

**Overlay Color**

└─ Button - Optional CTA
```

**Alternative Pattern:**

   └─ Paragraph
```

---

### Background Images

### Text Content

**Text Readability:**

- Test on different screen sizes
- Ensure contrast ratio meets WCAG standards

**Content Guidelines:**
- Keep text concise (panel width is limited when collapsed)
- Use hierarchy: large heading, smaller description
- Add CTA buttons for action
- Test expanded vs. collapsed states

---

### Content Alignment

Each Image Accordion Item has alignment controls:

**Vertical Alignment:**
- Top, Center, Bottom
- Where content sits within panel height

**Horizontal Alignment:**

## Best Practices

### Visual Design

**Image Selection:**
- Use high-quality, compelling images
- Maintain consistent aspect ratio
- Ensure images work both collapsed and expanded
- Test visibility of important details

**Color Overlays:**
- Use overlays for text readability
- Higher opacity on collapsed = focus on expanded
- Lower opacity on expanded = reveal image
- Test contrast ratios

**Content Layout:**
- Bottom-align content (common pattern)
- Use generous padding inside panels
- Keep collapsed state scannable
- Reveal more detail in expanded state

---

### Content Strategy

**Headlines:**
- Clear, descriptive titles
- Readable when collapsed (short)
- Intriguing enough to encourage expansion
- Consistent formatting across panels

**Descriptions:**
- Brief in collapsed state
- More detail when expanded (if desired)
- Front-load important information
- Use bullet points for scannability

**Calls to Action:**
- Add buttons for next steps
- Clear, action-oriented labels
- Ensure buttons are visible in both states
- Test click targets on mobile

---

### Interaction Design

**Hover vs. Click:**
- Hover: Fluid, exploratory, desktop-focused
- Click: Deliberate, touch-friendly, universal
- Consider your audience and device usage

**Default Expanded:**
- Use 0 for neutral presentation
- Use 1+ to highlight specific panel
- Don't use if all panels are equal priority

**Animation Speed:**
- Fast (0.3s): Modern, responsive
- Medium (0.5s): Balanced, default
- Slow (0.8s+): Luxurious, deliberate

---

### Performance

**Image Optimization:**
- Compress images before upload
- Use WebP format when possible
- Target < 200KB per image
- Test load times on mobile

**Panel Count:**
- Ideal: 3-6 panels
- Maximum: 8 panels
- More panels = narrower collapsed width

**Mobile Considerations:**
- Reduce height on mobile (use responsive controls)
- Test touch targets (min 44x44px)
- Ensure text is readable when collapsed
- Faster transitions on mobile (0.3-0.4s)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Panels Not Expanding

**Symptom**: Hover or click doesn't expand panels

**Possible Causes:**
1. Viewing in editor (effect only works on frontend)
2. JavaScript error
3. CSS conflict

**Solutions:**
- Preview on frontend
- Check browser console for errors
- Test with default WordPress theme
- Disable other plugins temporarily

---

### Text Hard to Read

**Symptom**: Content not visible over background images

**Solutions:**
1. Enable overlay color
2. Increase overlay opacity (60-80%)
3. Use darker overlay color
4. Add text shadow to content
5. Choose simpler background images

---

### Panels Too Narrow When Collapsed

**Symptom**: Content cut off or unreadable when collapsed

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce number of panels (4-5 max)
2. Decrease expansion ratio (2-3x)
3. Use shorter headlines
4. Remove content from collapsed state
5. Use icons instead of text

---

### Expanded Panel Not Obvious

**Symptom**: Can't tell which panel is expanded

**Solutions:**
1. Increase expansion ratio (4-5x)
2. Use stronger overlay opacity difference
3. Add border to expanded panel (custom CSS)
4. Increase transition duration for clarity

---

### Mobile Issues

**Common Problems:**

1. **Height too tall**
   - Reduce height to 300-400px on mobile
   - Use responsive settings

2. **Text too small**
   - Increase font size on mobile
   - Use larger headings

3. **Touch targets too small**
   - Entire panel is clickable
   - Ensure minimum 44px height

4. **Slow performance**
   - Optimize images
   - Reduce panel count
   - Test on real devices

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How many panels should I use?**
A: 3-6 panels is ideal. More than 8 makes collapsed panels too narrow.

**Q: Can I use videos as backgrounds?**
A: Not directly. Use background images with video blocks inside panels instead.

**Q: Why doesn't hover work on my tablet?**
A: Touch devices automatically use click mode. Hover requires a mouse.

**Q: Can panels be different heights?**
A: No, all panels share the same height for the accordion effect.

**Q: How do I link panels to other pages?**
A: Add button blocks with links, or wrap content in link blocks.

**Q: Can I have panels expand to different sizes?**
A: No, expansion ratio is the same for all panels.

**Q: Does it work in sidebars or widgets?**
A: Yes, but wide/full width works best. Narrow containers limit effectiveness.

**Q: Can I nest accordions?**
A: Not recommended - creates confusing interactions.

**Q: Why is my text cut off when collapsed?**
A: Use shorter headlines or reduce number of panels for wider collapsed width.

**Q: Can I disable expansion on certain panels?**
A: Not built-in. All panels are interactive by design.
