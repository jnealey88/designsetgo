DesignSetGo integrates with WordPress's built-in privacy tools (available since WordPress 4.9.6).

#### Exporting Personal Data

1. Go to **Tools → Export Personal Data**

3. Click **Send Request** or **Create and Download** for immediate export
4. DesignSetGo form submissions will be included in the export under "Form Submissions"

**What gets exported:**
- Submission ID
- Form ID
- Submission date
- All form field values
- IP address (if logging is enabled)
- User agent (if logging is enabled)
- Referrer (if logging is enabled)

#### Erasing Personal Data

1. Go to **Tools → Erase Personal Data**
2. Enter the user's email address
3. Click **Send Request** or **Erase Personal Data** for immediate erasure
4. All form submissions containing that email address will be permanently deleted

**What gets erased:**
- All form submissions where the email appears in any field
- All associated metadata (IP, user agent, etc.)
- Submissions are permanently deleted (not moved to trash)

### Privacy Policy

DesignSetGo provides suggested privacy policy text that you can add to your site's privacy policy:

if (data.success && data.items_removed) {
  console.log('Data successfully deleted');
}
```

### PHP Filters and Actions

#### Prevent Deletion Hook

Prevent specific submissions from being deleted:

```php
add_filter( 'designsetgo_can_delete_form_submission', function( $can_delete, $post_id, $email ) {
    // Keep submissions marked as important
    $is_important = get_post_meta( $post_id, '_important', true );

    if ( $is_important ) {
        return false; // Prevent deletion
    }

    return $can_delete;
}, 10, 3 );
```

#### After Erasure Hook

Perform actions after data is erased:

```php
add_action( 'designsetgo_form_submission_erased', function( $post_id, $email ) {
    // Log the erasure
    error_log( "Form submission {$post_id} erased for {$email}" );

    // Notify admin
    wp_mail(
        get_option( 'admin_email' ),
        'GDPR Data Erasure',
        "Form submission {$post_id} was erased per GDPR request."
    );
}, 10, 2 );
```

#### Custom Data Exporter

Add custom data to the export:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_privacy_personal_data_exporters', function( $exporters ) {
    $exporters['my-custom-data'] = array(
        'exporter_friendly_name' => 'My Custom Data',
        'callback'               => 'my_custom_data_exporter',
    );
    return $exporters;
} );

function my_custom_data_exporter( $email_address, $page = 1 ) {
    // Export custom data related to form submissions
    $export_items = array();

    // Your custom export logic here

    return array(
        'data' => $export_items,
        'done' => true,
    );
}
```

### Programmatic Access

#### Export Data Programmatically

```php
// Get GDPR compliance instance
$gdpr = new \DesignSetGo\Includes\Admin\GDPR_Compliance();

// Export data for an email address
$result = $gdpr->export_form_submissions( 'user@example.com', 1 );

if ( ! empty( $result['data'] ) ) {
    foreach ( $result['data'] as $item ) {
        // Process exported data
        $submission_id = $item['item_id'];
        $data = $item['data'];
    }
}
```

#### Erase Data Programmatically

```php
// Get GDPR compliance instance
$gdpr = new \DesignSetGo\Includes\Admin\GDPR_Compliance();

// Erase data for an email address
$result = $gdpr->erase_form_submissions( 'user@example.com', 1 );

if ( $result['items_removed'] ) {
    // Data successfully erased
    echo 'Personal data has been erased.';
}

if ( $result['items_retained'] ) {
    // Some data was retained
    foreach ( $result['messages'] as $message ) {
        echo $message;
    }
}
```

---

## Data Retention

### Current Policy

By default, DesignSetGo retains form submissions indefinitely. This allows you to:
- Review historical submissions
- Respond to inquiries over time
- Maintain records for business purposes

### Implementing Automatic Deletion

You can implement automatic deletion of old submissions using WordPress's built-in cron:

```php
// Delete submissions older than 90 days
add_action( 'init', function() {
    if ( ! wp_next_scheduled( 'designsetgo_cleanup_old_submissions' ) ) {
        wp_schedule_event( time(), 'daily', 'designsetgo_cleanup_old_submissions' );
    }
} );

add_action( 'designsetgo_cleanup_old_submissions', function() {
    $args = array(
        'post_type'      => 'dsg_form_submission',
        'posts_per_page' => 100,
        'post_status'    => 'private',
        'date_query'     => array(
            array(
                'before' => '90 days ago',
            ),
        ),
    );

    $old_submissions = new WP_Query( $args );

    if ( $old_submissions->have_posts() ) {
        while ( $old_submissions->have_posts() ) {
            $old_submissions->the_post();
            wp_delete_post( get_the_ID(), true );
        }
    }

    wp_reset_postdata();
} );
```

### Data Retention Notice

Site administrators will see a notice on the form submissions screen with:
- Link to WordPress Privacy Tools
- Link to Privacy Policy settings
- Reminder about GDPR compliance

---

## User Rights Under GDPR

### Right to Access

Users can request a copy of their personal data. This is handled through:
- WordPress's "Export Personal Data" tool
- REST API endpoint: `/wp-json/designsetgo/v1/gdpr/export`

### Right to Rectification

Users can request correction of inaccurate data. Site administrators should:
1. Navigate to **Form Submissions**
2. Find the relevant submission
3. Edit the submission data manually

### Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")

Users can request deletion of their personal data. This is handled through:
- WordPress's "Erase Personal Data" tool
- REST API endpoint: `/wp-json/designsetgo/v1/gdpr/delete`

### Right to Data Portability

Data is exported in a structured, machine-readable format (JSON) that can be:
- Downloaded by users
- Imported into other systems
- Used for migration purposes

### Right to Object

Users can object to processing of their data. Site administrators should:
1. Stop collecting data from that user
2. Delete existing data using erasure tools
3. Block the user's email from future submissions (if necessary)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Minimize Data Collection

Only collect data that is necessary:
```php
// Example: Disable IP logging if not needed
add_filter( 'designsetgo_form_log_ip_addresses', '__return_false' );
```

### 2. Regular Data Audits

Periodically review and clean up old submissions:
- Check for outdated data
- Remove unnecessary metadata
- Archive important submissions

### 3. Secure Data Storage

- Keep WordPress updated
- Use strong passwords
- Limit admin access
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Use HTTPS

### 4. Transparent Communication

- Keep privacy policy up to date
- Inform users about data collection
- Make privacy tools easily accessible
- Respond promptly to data requests

### 5. Document Compliance

- Keep records of data requests
- Document deletion processes
- Maintain audit logs
- Train staff on GDPR procedures
