## 💡 Pro Tips

### For SVN Upload (After Approval)
The `/images/` folder assets go into the SVN `/assets/` directory, NOT in the plugin ZIP:

```bash
# After WordPress.org approval:
svn co https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/designsetgo designsetgo-svn
cd designsetgo-svn

# Copy assets to SVN assets folder
cp ../designsetgo/images/banner-*.png assets/
cp ../designsetgo/images/icon-*.png assets/
cp ../designsetgo/images/icon.svg assets/
cp ../designsetgo/images/screenshot-*.png assets/

# Commit assets
svn add assets/*
svn ci -m "Add plugin assets (banners, icons, screenshots)"
```

### Asset Best Practices
- ✅ **Icons**: Square, recognizable at small sizes
- ✅ **Banners**: Descriptive, not cluttered, brand colors
- ✅ **Screenshots**: Show features, not just code
- ✅ **File sizes**: Optimized but not over-compressed
- ✅ **Consistency**: Same style across all assets
