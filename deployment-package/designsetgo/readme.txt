== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a page builder plugin? =

No! DesignSetGo works with the native WordPress block editor (Gutenberg). You don't need Elementor, Beaver Builder, or any other page builder.

= Does this work with Full Site Editing (FSE)? =

Yes! All blocks are fully compatible with Full Site Editing and the Site Editor. You can use them in templates, template parts, and patterns.

= Is this compatible with my theme? =

DesignSetGo is designed to work with any modern WordPress theme. It respects your theme's colors, spacing, and typography settings from theme.json.

= Will this slow down my site? =

No! DesignSetGo is built for performance:
- Editor bundle: < 100 KB (continuously optimized)
- Frontend bundle: < 20 KB per block
- CSS bundle: < 30 KB total
- No jQuery dependency (saves 150 KB)
- Optimized animations using CSS and Intersection Observer
- Progressive enhancement - core layouts work without JavaScript
- Declarative styles apply instantly (no render delays)
- Code-split per block - only loads what you use

= Can I use these blocks with the Classic Editor? =

DesignSetGo requires the block editor (Gutenberg). If you're using the Classic Editor plugin, you'll need to switch to the block editor to use these blocks.

= Is this a freemium plugin? =

The free version is fully functional with all features included. We may offer premium add-ons in the future, but the core plugin will always remain free.

= How do I get support? =

- Check the [documentation](https://designsetgoblocks.com/docs/)
- Visit the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/designsetgo/)
- Report bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/designsetgo/designsetgo)

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =

Yes! You can use DesignSetGo blocks on any WooCommerce page, including product pages, shop pages, and custom layouts.

= Does the Form Builder work with contact form plugins? =

DesignSetGo includes a complete built-in Form Builder with 11 field types, AJAX submission, spam protection, and email notifications. You don't need Contact Form 7, WPForms, or Gravity Forms - everything is included! However, DesignSetGo blocks work alongside other form plugins if needed.

= How many blocks are included? =

DesignSetGo includes 47 blocks organized into four main categories: Container System (5), Form Builder System (13), Interactive Blocks (10), Visual & UI Blocks (13), plus Child Blocks (6). Additionally, there are 7 universal extensions that work with ANY WordPress block (including core blocks and third-party blocks): Block Animations, Responsive Visibility, Background Video, Clickable Groups, Sticky Header Controls, Custom CSS, and Grid Span.

= Can I use these blocks with page builders like Elementor? =

DesignSetGo is designed to work with the native WordPress block editor (Gutenberg), eliminating the need for heavy page builders. It provides similar functionality with better performance and no vendor lock-in. You can use DesignSetGo blocks within the WordPress block editor on pages built with page builders that support the editor, though this isn't the recommended approach.

= Does the editor match the frontend exactly? =

Yes! DesignSetGo uses WordPress core patterns (useBlockProps, useInnerBlocksProps) to ensure 100% editor/frontend parity. What you see in the editor is exactly what appears on your live site. No surprises, no mismatches, no "why does it look different" moments.

= Can I translate this plugin? =

Absolutely! DesignSetGo is fully internationalized and ready for translation. Visit [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/designsetgo/) to contribute.
