= Why DesignSetGo? =

✓ **Works Like WordPress** - If you know blocks, you know DesignSetGo. No separate interface, no learning curve.
✓ **52 Blocks, One Plugin** - Replaces multiple plugins: forms, sliders, tabs, accordions, counters, cards, maps, modals, breadcrumbs, timelines, and more.
✓ **16 Universal Extensions** - Add animations, scroll effects, parallax, responsive visibility, sticky headers, clickable groups, draft mode, max width, and more to ANY WordPress block (including core blocks).
✓ **Text Style Format** - Apply custom colors, gradients, font sizes, and highlights to selected text inline, just like bold or italic.
✓ **Performance First** - Lightweight code, no jQuery, optimized bundles. Your site stays fast.

✓ **Editor = Frontend** - What you see in the editor is exactly what appears on your site. No surprises.
✓ **Built-in Admin Tools** - Form submissions dashboard, revision comparison, draft mode for published pages, and organized settings.

= Will this work with my theme? =

Yes! DesignSetGo is designed to work with any modern WordPress theme. It respects your theme's colors, spacing, and typography settings from theme.json. Tested with Twenty Twenty-Five and FSE themes.

= Will this slow down my site? =

No! DesignSetGo is built for performance. The entire CSS bundle is under 10 KB gzipped, there's no jQuery dependency, and blocks only load what you actually use. Your PageSpeed scores stay high.

= Do I need to know how to code? =

Not at all. If you can use WordPress blocks, you can use DesignSetGo. Everything is controlled through the familiar block inspector—no code required. (But if you want to add custom CSS to any block, you can!)

= What happens if I deactivate the plugin? =

Your content stays intact. Because DesignSetGo uses WordPress standards, your layouts won't break—they'll just render as standard containers and content. No proprietary markup means no lock-in.

= Does the editor match the frontend? =

Yes, exactly. DesignSetGo uses the same patterns as WordPress core blocks to guarantee what you see in the editor is what appears on your live site. No surprises.

No! DesignSetGo includes a complete form builder with 11 field types, AJAX submission, spam protection, and email notifications. Everything is built-in and works without external services.

= Does this work with Full Site Editing (FSE)? =

Absolutely. All blocks work seamlessly with FSE, the Site Editor, templates, and template parts. The Sticky Header extension is specifically designed for FSE header template parts.
